            Announcement: Webinar on 20th March
        </h4>
        <p>
        We are launching the plant virology crowdsourcing hub on Friday 20th March by holding an explanatory webinar.
        The webinar will start at 11am GMT. If you would like to pre-register, please see the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/webinar-using-crowdsourcing-in-plant-virology-tickets-15775624317">registration page</a>. We will be publishing links to the Google Hangout on 19th March once these have been finalised.

            FERA is organising a one-hour webinar on the use of crowdsourcing in plant virology that will start at 11am (GMT) on 20th March 2015. It is aimed at plant virologists and bioinformaticians involved in plant virology analyses.<br>
            Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techologies have revolutionised the way in which we sequence the genomes of plant viruses. Crowdsourcing has been used previously to concentrate the work of interested scientists around acute problems in an outbreak of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli in Germany and the introduction to the UK of the ash dieback fungus H. fraxinus. Given the small number of plant virologists world-wide and the specialist bioinformatics skills required to analyse NGS datasets, we believe that a crowdsourcing approach to the analysis of plant virus NGS datasets would be extremely beneficial.<br>
            The webinar will last for one hour (at the most) and will introduce interested plant virologists and bioinformaticians to:
            <ol><li>The benefits of open access science</li>
            <li>A crowdsourcing framework developed especially for plant virology and implemented at github.com</li>
            <li>The potential of crowdsourcing to help develop the breadth of bioinformatics skills in plant virology and for greater collaboration between plant virology research groups.</li></ol>
            The webinar will be interactive but no prior knowledge of github or crowdsourcing is required in order to participate. If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.
        </p>
